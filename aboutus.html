            <p> 
                My name is Jonathan, and I  attend Toronto French School. 
                For me to graduate and receive my diploma, I need to complete a program 
                called <em>CAS</em>. <em>CAS</em> stands for <em>creativity</em>, <em>activity</em> 
                and <em>service</em>, each of these categories requires an extracurricular activity. 
                On top of these three activities, I also need to complete a 
                long-term service project. Due to our current circumstances, 
                I thought creating a website would be smarter and more fun. I will not be using a 
                website design site but rather  HTML and CSS since I wanted a challenge, 
                and I thought it would be fun to learn.

                I thought it would be fun to lebe coding this project solely using 
                HTML and CSS since I wanted a challenge. 
            </p>

                Realistically, this will not get the attention of many people; however, 
                even if I can attract ten people and inform them about global warming, 
                I think it will make the world a better place. Many people know that global 
                warming is a thing but choose not to act because it's "not that serious," but it is 
                severe; the earth is our home, and we need to keep it clean.
