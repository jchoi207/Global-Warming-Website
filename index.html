            <H1>Global Warming: What is it?</H1>
            <br><br>
            <p>

                Global warming is a phenomenon that occurs due to the increasingly rising temperatures
                created by human activity. Global warming can include increasing sea levels, warmer
                days, more weather-related natural
                disasters and it can be the cause of the extinction of several animal species. Global warming, also
                called climate change is caused by gas molecules known as
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" target="_blank">
                    greenhouse gases</a>. These gases are released into the atmosphere due to mass pollution from
                burning
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/fossil-fuel#:~:text=Fossil%20fuels%20i
        nclude%20coal%2C%20petroleum,to%202.5%20billion%20years%20ago)." target="_blank">
                    fossil fuels</a>, such as oil, petrol and coal. Once in the atmosphere, the gases begin trapping the
                sun's infrared light by absorbing the

                solar radiation reflected off the earth. As their name suggests, greenhouse gases act as
                earth's glass pane, restraining heat from escaping, but letting it in, hence the scientific
                term:
                greenhouse gas. We can prevent the effects of greenhouse gases by limiting and even eliminating
                the use of fossil fuels in human activities. This may seem like a problem but there already are existing
                solutions that could replace
                our usage of fossil fuels. The best alternative would be sources of renewable energy like; solar panels,
                wind turbines, hydropower and plenty other solutions. However, these options are more expensive and
                would costmillions of dollars
                to get rid of generators that use fossil fuels and to switch them out for generators that use renewable
                energy.

            <h1 class="whiteHeader">Why should you want to help?</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                It's the same thing as asking yourself why should you help others? To feel better about yourself? Will
                you expect something in return? Or do you help because it's the right thing to do? Regarding climate
                change, you will not receive anything in return
                from others or even recognition. Still, you will know that you took action under your consciousness and
                helped sustain our planet for current and future generations. This does not mean that your actions have
                to be tremendous efforts like
                going off the grid because minute conserved actions count as well. Many sayings go like, "imagine if
                every person on the earth picked up one piece of trash every day," reinforcing the notion that actions
                can be modest but have to be followed
                through.

            <h1 class="whiteHeader">How can you help?</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Being able to get all the people on the planet to use green energy over fossil fuels or getting
                people to take the bus more often doesnâ€™t seem like something that you could possibly do to help in the
                fight against global warming.
                So what can you do? You can try to change your own lifestyle. Try using your car less for small travels.
                Take public transport or carpool to reduce carbon emissions. There are an infinite number of ways that
                you can help here are a bunch
                more:

            <br><br>
            <p>
                The rapidly changing temperatures are a large problem since some living things cannot adapt as quickly
                as others; species are going extinct, and currently, there are
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/what-makes-a-species-endangered" target="blank">7000</a>
                endangered species, including fauna and flora. Species such as the Hawksbill Turtle, the Great
                Hammerhead, the Black Rhino, the Whale Shark
                and the Sunda Tiger. However, the list is extensive and are many others that are on the verge of
                extinction. Drastic measures need to be taken, and we need to protect these species as they each play a
                vital role in the sustentation of
                their ecosystems. When plants and animals become endangered, it is a signal that their ecosystems are
                slowly degrading; we rely heavily on certain ecosystems for purification, food and oxygen.

            <h1>Purification</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Ecosystems of the world are responsible for purifying our oxygen but also our water. Wetlands such as
                the
                Amazon absorb a large percentage of the sediments and pollutants in our water. The soil and flora of
                ecosystems aid
                in
                the
                filtration of these fine particles leaving us with cleaner water down the line. An example of
                an
                ecosystem at work is beaver dams; beaver dams have been observed to absorb 1000 times more nitrogen
                compared to no dams. Engineers have been copying this design to protect water streams against
                excess
                quantities of nitrogen which stimulates aquatic plant and algae growth; the invasive
                and
                parasitic nature of algae harms aquatic life and degrades ecosystems. The slowing of water by
                beaver-dams
                allows bacteria to react with the nitrates to produce nitrogen gas, for without the relatively still
                currents, there is no time for the process to occur.
